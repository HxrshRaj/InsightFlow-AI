# 🧠 PyTorch Model (Standalone)

A feedforward PyTorch regressor (California Housing) with a documented training-debugging case study lives in [`ml/`](ml/) — see [`docs/pytorch-model.md`](docs/pytorch-model.md). It is not part of the Streamlit app.

---

# 🎯 Future Enhancements

* User Authentication
* SQLite-based Dataset History
* Multi-file Data Processing
* REST API Integration
* Docker Support
* Cloud Storage Integration
* Scheduled ETL Pipelines
* Apache Spark Integration
* Apache Airflow Workflow Automation

---

# 💼 Resume Highlights

* Built an AI-powered data analytics platform using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly to automate dataset validation, preprocessing, visualization, and reporting.

* Trained and debugged a PyTorch regression model on California Housing (standalone `ml/` module): diagnosed unstable training as a feature-scaling issue and cut test RMSE from 0.755 to 0.528 (5-seed mean); see `docs/pytorch-model.md`.

* Developed modular data engineering components for data quality assessment, automated cleaning, interactive analytics, and report generation.

* Integrated Groq LLM to generate executive summaries, business insights, risk analysis, and actionable recommendations from structured datasets.

* Designed a scalable architecture that supports future enterprise integrations while maintaining a clean, modular, and deployable MVP.
